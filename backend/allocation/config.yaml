# Configuration for PQDAG Fragment Allocation System
# This file will be dynamically generated by the GUI based on the current dataset

# This should point to the PQDAG GUI project root directory

# Relative to base_path: storage/outputdata/

# Path to the global affectation file (will be generated)
# Stored in storage/allocation_results/ for better organization
# Note: The filename does not include dataset name suffix

# Temporary directory for assembling files per worker before distribution
# Uses storage/allocation_temp/ for better organization and cleanup

# Destination path on both master and worker machines
# This directory will be created if it doesn't exist

# Includes dataset name as subdirectory to support multiple datasets
